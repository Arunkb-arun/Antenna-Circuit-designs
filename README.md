# Antenna & Circuit designs

This repository contains a collection of antenna and circuit designs I developed using HFSS, CST and ADS. These designs are intended for various applications such as Interweave cognitive radios systems, Dual-band and wideband communications and more
## Antenna design for Interweave cognitive radio systems
- **Broadband antenna**: Bowtie antenna that covers 24 - 38 GHz.
- **Reconfigurable antenna 1**:
  -  Antenna 2 demonstrates reconfigurability through PIN diode switching:
    - ON state: 24 GHz to 26 GHz
    - OFF state: 25 GHz to 27.7 GHz
- **Reconfigurable antenna 2**:
