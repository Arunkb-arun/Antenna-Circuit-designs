# Antenna design for Interweave cognitive radio systems

This repository details the design and simulation of the proposed antenna system using HFSS.
It includes one broadband bowtie slot antenna (Antenna 1) for spectrum sensing and two narrowband frequency-reconfigurable antennas (Antennas 2 and 3) using PIN diode switching.
The simulation process, design formulas, substrate selection, and configuration parameters are
thoroughly described. The antennas are optimized for performance in the 24â€“40 GHz range.
## Antennas in the System
- **Broadband antenna**: Bowtie antenna that covers 24 - 38 GHz.
- **Reconfigurable antenna 1**:<br>
    Antenna 2 demonstrates reconfigurability through PIN diode switching:
    - ON state: 24 GHz to 26 GHz
    - OFF state: 25 GHz to 27.7 GHz
      
- **Reconfigurable antenna 2**:<br>
    Antenna 3 also exhibits reconfigurable performance:
    - ON state: 29 GHz to 32 GHz
    - OFF state: 30 GHz to 34 GHz
